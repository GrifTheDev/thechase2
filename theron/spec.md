# Connecting
Upon connecting to the Theron Websocket Service you will recieve a message of type `CREDENTIALS_REQUEST`. The client must provide a `game_code` upon which Theron will return a `client_id` the client *MUST* provide in all requests to Theron. If the client is the game admin, an `authorization_token` alongside the `game-code` must be provided before a `client_id` is assigned. If the client was connected, but wishes to reconnect, it must provide it's assigned `client_id`
